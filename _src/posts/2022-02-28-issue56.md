    Title: Racket News - Issue 56
    Date: 2022-02-28T21:00:00

Welcome to the fifty-sixth issue of Racket News. 

Hello everyone - welcome to issue 56 and 2022. This issue has been in the making for way too long and I have decided to publish what I have slowly been putting together. A quick recap of the last few months is unnecessary but one personal issue after another meant I lacked the ability to focus on anything besides the most essential work I needed to do. My apologies for the long silence and thanks to everyone who contacted me showing support. My hope is that this issue will highlight most of the things that happened in the last few months. I will not attempt to publish another issue again in two weeks though. I need to regroup and reorganize, and prepare the year 2021 review to come out next issue. Therefore, I am planning to publish another issue in 4 weeks. If you have any questions or suggestions [let me know](mailto:p@ocmatos.com).

Grab a good cup of coffee. Enjoy!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Qi](https://docs.racket-lang.org/qi/index.html) by Siddhartha Kasivajhula.

From the website:

> Qi is an embeddable, general-purpose language to allow convenient framing of programming logic in terms of functional flows.

Check out the [Tutorial](https://docs.racket-lang.org/qi/Tutorial.html).

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [A Small Scheme VM, Compiler, and REPL in 4K](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h0GK3G2_9wq7jYPLkV1x9nwAvaCJzNpt/view?usp=sharing) by Samuel Yvon and Marc Feeley.

Abstract:

> Compact language implementations are increasingly popular for use in resource constrained environments. For embedded applications such as robotics and home automation, it is useful to support a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) so that a basic level of interactive development is possible directly on the device. Due to its minimalistic design, the Scheme language is particularly well suited for such applications and several implementations are available with different tradeoffs. In this paper we explain the design and implementation of Ribbit, a compact Scheme system that supports a REPL, is extensible and has a 4 KB executable code footprint.
