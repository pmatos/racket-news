    Title: Racket News - Issue 49
    Date: 2021-05-03T21:00:00
    Tags: DRAFT

Welcome to the forty-ninth issue of Racket News.

At this point, you might have noticed the missing issues in April. For that I apologize. This year has not been treating me kindly and things got really bad during the month of April. This made me unable to focus on Racket News (and just about every else I regularly did). But fear not, things have improved considerably. Lets put that now behind our backs and move on with a new month and more Racket.

If you just recently subscribed to Racket News, Welcome! Although there was no issue during April, I try to have two issues per month. One published during the first Monday of the month and one on the Monday on or after the 15th of the month. So you can expect next issue to come on week 20, on the 17th or throughout that week.

Due to the missing issue last month, this issue has project stats for both March and April and you'll notice the heroic effort of the community in cleaning stale issues, having closed 72 issues in the month of April alone. 

The Racketfest videos are now up on Youtube as well and there's a lot of catch up to do. So lets start!

Grab one ginormous coffee cup and enjoy!

# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there. Do you have a favourite script? [Share it](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/issues/new) with us!

The featured Quickscript this time around is `abstract-variable`: Create a variable from the selected expression.

This is a classic from the `quickscript-extra` collection.

Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgjAZd4eBBY>

```
#lang racket/base
(require racket/gui
         quickscript)

(script-help-string
 "Create a variable from the selected expression
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgjAZd4eBBY)")

(define-script abstract-variable
  #:label "&Abstract variable"
  #:menu-path ("Re&factor")
  (λ (str) 
    (cond
      [(string=? str "")
       (message-box "Empty selection"
                    "No expression selected"
                    #f
                    '(ok caution))]
      [else
       (define var (get-text-from-user "Variable Abstraction" "Variable name:"
                                       #:validate (λ (s) #t)))
       (if var
           (begin
             (send the-clipboard set-clipboard-string 
                   (string-append "(define " var " " str ")")
                   0)
             var)
           str)])))

;; Select `"badinka"`, then click on Script>Abstract variable, enter `my-var`,
;; add a newline just after `begin` and past what's in the clipboard.
#;(begin
    (string-append "zorglub" "badinka"))
```

[Quickscript](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/) is included in DrRacket, and scripts are managed by the **Script** menu. See the documentation at https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Does Blame Shifting Work?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1omv_9uXhnHFj4IRYJsOTbaK8lH3rT90k/view?usp=sharing) by Lukas Lazarek, Alexis King, Samanvitha Sundar, Robert Findler, and Christos Dimoulas.

Abstract:

> Contract systems, especially of the higher-order flavor, go hand in hand with blame. The pragmatic purpose of blame is to narrow down the code that a programmer needs to examine to locate the bug when the contract system discovers a contract violation. Or so the literature on higher-order contracts claims.
> In reality, however, there is neither empirical nor theoretical evidence that connects blame with the location of bugs. The reputation of blame as a tool for weeding out bugs rests on anecdotes about how programmers use contracts to shift blame and their attention from one part of a program to another until they discover the source of the problem.
> This paper aims to fill the apparent gap and shed light to the relation between blame and bugs. To that end, we introduce an empirical methodology for investigating whether, for a given contract system, it is possible to translate blame information to the location of bugs in a systematic manner. Our methodology is inspired by how programmers attempt to increase the precision of the contracts of a blamed component in order to shift blame to another component, which becomes the next candidate for containing the bug. In particular, we construct a framework that enables us to ask for a contract system whether (i) the process of blame shifting causes blame to eventually settle to the component that contains the bug; and (ii) every shift moves blame "closer" to the faulty component.
> Our methodology offers a rigorous means for evaluating the pragmatics of contract systems, and we employ it to analyze Racket's contract system. Along the way, we uncover subtle points about the pragmatic meaning of contracts and blame in Racket: (i) the expressiveness of Racket's off-the-shelf contract language is not sufficient to narrow down the blamed portion of the code to the faulty component in all cases; and (ii) contracts that trigger state changes (even unexpectedly, perhaps in the runtime system's data structures or caches) interfere with program evaluation in subtle ways and thus blame shifting can lead programmers on a detour when searching for a bug. These points highlight how evaluations such as ours suggest fixes to language design.
