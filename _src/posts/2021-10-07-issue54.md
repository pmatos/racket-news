    Title: Racket News - Issue 54
    Date: 2021-10-07T21:00:00
    Tags: DRAFT

Welcome to the fifty-fourth issue of Racket News.

Hello everyone and welcome to a new issue. I am fresh from a long leave, probably the longest in my work life and I am feeling refreshed. Hope you are holding on tight, 'cause we have a lot to go through!

A note on emails... I am consolidating my email addresses and accounts to using only two. So you should be seeing emails coming from `p@ocmatos.com` from here on out. This is the email you should be using as well if you want to contact me privately. 

Grab a large coffee! No - not that small. Larger still ...and enjoy the issue!

# Call to Racket!

I am taking a break for this issue... still not sure where to go with this section but I am thinking about it. It turns out this was less popular than I initially expected and due to the amount of un-triaged bugs in the racket repos, it's also hard to choose one that's ameanable to those who are just starting to contribute. If you have any suggestions about this, [let me know](mailto:p@ocmatos.com).

<div id='quick'/>
# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there. Do you have a favourite script? [Share it](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/issues/new) with us!

If you want to run Guile files within DrRacket, you will need to invoke the Guile runtime. Here's a quick-and-dirty quickscript that does that for you, assuming you are using Linux or Mac:

```
#lang racket/base
(require quickscript
         racket/system
         racket/port
         racket/class)
(define-script guile-run
  #:label "Guile Run"
  (λ (selection #:file fi #:interactions ints #:frame drr)
    (define str1 (format "Running Guile on ~a\n" (path->string fi)))
    (define out-str
      (with-output-to-string (λ () (system* "/usr/bin/env" "guile" (path->string fi)))))
    (send drr ensure-rep-shown ints)
    (send ints reset-console)
    (send ints insert
          (string-append str1
                         (make-string (string-length str1) #\—)
                         "\n"))
    (send ints insert out-str)
    #f))
```

Open a Guile file in DrRacket. DrRacket may not recognise that it's not a racket file, so you may see some errors, but forget about them.
Click on Scripts|Run Guile and you should see the output of your Guile program in the interaction windows.

Notes:
- It's very simple (written in 15min), it doesn't implement a REPL, it only prints the output. If your program is asking the user for input, it will hang. If your program hangs, it will hang too.
- Guile must be accessible via /usr/bin/env guile
- The script above can be easily adapted to support most other interpreters.
- DrRacket will also syntax-color guile files like scheme files, so it shouldn't be too bad. DrRacket may yell because there's no #lang line, but you can disable you can "disable background expansion" by clicking on the red disk at the bottom right corner of DrRacket
- You may want to check Edit|Modes|Scheme mode.

Here's an example of a test program:

```
(display "Hello, world!")
(newline)
```

Installation: you can paste this into a new script via the menu: Scripts > Manage > New

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [congame](https://github.com/marckaufmann/congame) by Marc Kaufmann and Bogdan Popa.

From the website:

> congame is the best experimental economics software written in Racket. zTree and oTree are two common experimental economics platforms. The reason for building congame is the usual: I used oTree for some of my experiments, but found that it lacked some specific features I needed in my experiments.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [How to Design Co-Programs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dGt0hrwwaG3t6xyJsJWeIk8xALdR9VKJ/view?usp=sharing), by Jeremy Gibbons.

Abstract:

> The observation that program structure follows data structure is a key lesson in introductory programming: good hints for possible program designs can be found by considering the structure of the data concerned. In particular, this lesson is a core message of the influential textbook “How to Design Programs” by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi. However, that book discusses using only the structure of input data for guiding program design, typically leading towards structurally recursive programs. We argue that novice programmers should also be taught to consider the structure of output data, leading them also towards structurally corecursive programs.
