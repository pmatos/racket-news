    Title: Racket News - Issue 53
    Date: 2021-08-17T21:00:00
    
Welcome to the fifty-third issue of Racket News.

As you might have noticed there was a long hiatus between this and the previous newsletter. However, summer holidays and getting married has gotten in the way of sitting down and releasing an issue of Racket News. I am still not done as I am about to leave on a honeymoon, so expect the next issue to come mid-September, possibly week 37 of 2021.

In any case, we have a lot of ground to cover, so grab a coffee and enjoy the issue!

# What's New?

* [Racket v8.2](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2021/07/racket-v8-2.html) has been released. Racket CS has improved performance of large-integer arithmetic, support for nonatomic allocation via `ffi/unsafe` and cross-compilation through the `raco cross` tool among many other things.
* This old blog post on [Thoughts On Lisp And Racket](https://www.macadie.net/2019/08/11/thoughts-on-lisp-and-racket/) recently made HNs first page. Time to revisit it!
* As part of a Programming languages course on Coursera there's a video on [Racket Macros with define-syntax](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/programming-languages-part-b/optional-racket-macros-with-define-syntax-0XyWE) that you probably shouldn't miss.
* Check some more Racket Hacking fun with Bogdan Popa on Youtube: [Declarative GUIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXJ9tTVGDwU).
* D. Ben Knoble has put up a project to [archive slack channels](https://benknoble.github.io/racket-slack-archive/).

# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there. Do you have a favourite script? [Share it](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/issues/new) with us!

Quickscript to move the current (saved) tab to a new DrRacket window ([gist](https://gist.github.com/Metaxal/bfef2b3ee77f3e40aa449d87851dbf81)):

```
#lang racket/base

(require quickscript
         quickscript/utils
         racket/class
         drracket/tool-lib
         racket/gui/base)

(script-help-string "move the current (saved) tab to a new DrRacket window")

(define-script move-to-new-window
  #:label "Move tab to new window"
  #:menu-path ("&Utils")
  (λ (selection #:definitions defs #:frame fr)
    (define fname (send defs get-filename))    
    (cond
      [(or (not fname)
           (send defs is-modified?))
       (message-box "Cannot move window"
                    "The editor must be saved before moving it to a new window")]
      [else
       (define fr2 (drracket:unit:open-drscheme-window #f))
       (define txt (send fr2 get-definitions-text))
       (smart-open-file fr2 fname)
       (send fr close-current-tab)])
    #f))

(module url2script-info racket/base
  (provide filename url)
  (define filename "move-to-new-window.rkt")
  (define url "https://gist.github.com/Metaxal/bfef2b3ee77f3e40aa449d87851dbf81"))
```

[Laurent Orseau](https://github.com/metaxal) had to make a small change to Quickscript, so you'll need the latest version of quickscript to make it work. The bonus is that the new version of Quickscript has access to everything in `drracket/tool-lib` without opening a new instance of drracket each time!

Installation: you can paste this into a new script via the menu: Scripts > Manage > New

From the website:

> RSound is a sound engine for Racket.  This collection provides a means to represent, read, write, play, and manipulate sounds.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [How to Evaluate Blame for Gradual Types](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VkU_Yoq3vbRwiF1KQOcqM9QKtOETS7Sq/view?usp=sharing), by Lukas Lazarek, Ben Greenman, Matthias Felleisen, and Christos Dimoulas.

Abstract:

> Programming language theoreticians develop blame assignment systems and prove blame theorems for gradually typed programming languages. Practical implementations of gradual typing almost completely ignore the idea of blame assignment. This contrast raises the question whether blame provides any value to the working programmer and poses the challenge of how to evaluate the effectiveness of blame assignment strategies. This paper contributes (1) the first evaluation method for blame assignment strategies and (2) the results from applying it to three different semantics for gradual typing. These results cast doubt on the theoretical effectiveness of blame in gradual typing. In most scenarios, strategies with imprecise blame assignment are as helpful to a rationally acting programmer as strategies with provably correct blame. 

There's a [video available for the paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S7BYbYb6Yk).
