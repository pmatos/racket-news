Welcome to the forty-sixth issue of Racket News.

[Racket version 8.0](https://download.racket-lang.org/v8.0.html) is here! That's the news of the week and it should fill you with joy and warm feelings. It ships with the ChezScheme backend as the default. Other than that [Racketfest](https://racketfest.com) is back and Jesse just announced it in a slightly different online format: Amateur Nights.

Now grab an espresso and lets dive in!

# What's New?

* Racket v8.0 is finally here. This is a big deal given that it's not only a major version, but it also brings by the first time as default the CS (highly-modified ChezScheme) backend. If you look at the last major versions, it's not something that happens everyday: 5.0 was out June 2010 (over 10 years ago), 6.0 out February, 2014, and 7.0 in July 2018. So that about every 4 years for a major version with this one coming slightly early. So rejoice and enjoy v8.0. As usual, if you find any bugs or issues, make sure you [report them](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/new).
* Jesse Alama has announced a prelude to [Racketfest - Racketfest Amateur Night](https://racketfest.com/) featuring primarily short talks. Go on and register, come and show us what you're up to!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [`argo`](https://docs.racket-lang.org/argo/index.html) by Jesse Alama.

From the website:

> Argo is a JSON Schema validator. Work with your JSON data knowing that it adheres to some sensible constraints. If you have to work with JSON, even if only occasionally, you may want to consider validating it (that is, checking that is satisfies the constraints specified by the schema).

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Macros that Work Together - Compile-Time Bindings, Partial Expansion, and Definition Contexts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VHhJGhh44Sq9YCs30GkpMT9hCnCeTmD-/view?usp=sharing) by Matthew Flatt, Ryan Culpepper, David Darais, and Robert Findler.

Abstract:

> Racket is a large language that is built mostly within itself. Unlike the usual approach taken by non-Lisp languages, the self-hosting of Racket is not a matter of bootstrapping one implementation through a previous implementation, but instead a matter of building a tower of languages and libraries via macros. The upper layers of the tower include a class system, a component system, pedagogic variants of Scheme, a statically typed dialect of Scheme, and more. The demands of this language-construction effort require a macro system that is substantially more expressive than previous macro systems. In particular, while conventional Scheme macro systems handle stand-alone syntactic forms adequately, they provide weak support for macros that share information or macros that use existing syntactic forms in new contexts.
> This paper describes and models features of the Racket macro system, including support for general compile-time bindings, sub-form expansion and analysis, and environment management. The presentation assumes a basic familiarity with Lisp-style macros, and it takes for granted the need for macros that respect lexical scope. The model, however, strips away the pattern and template system that is normally associated with Scheme macros, isolating a core that is simpler, can support pattern and template forms themselves as macros, and generalizes naturally to Racket’s other extensions.
