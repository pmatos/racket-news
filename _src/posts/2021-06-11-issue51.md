# What's New?

* From [Racket Stories](https://racket-stories.com): this interesting post on [text editors](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/lucas.paul/posts/2017-07-31-making-an-editor.html) by Lucas Paul.
* A shoutout to the [`raco cross` tool](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco-cross/index.html) Matthew Flatt created last month that provides a convenient interface to cross-compile Racket. I really think we need better tooling in this area and something like this is a step in the right direction. Also take a look at the [announcement in the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-users/c/WU0wEtP_IOI/m/O_gW2zxlBAAJ).
* There's an interesting thread on `racket-dev` on understanding the [implementation of `for/fold`](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-dev/c/eRHjAeKEvCw/m/7KQdE6ToBgAJ)
* The Racket irc channel `#racket` is now in [libera.chat](https://libera.chat), for more information look at the [announcement in the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-users/c/wNKll3IyeRo/m/fQtQ6hfmAgAJ).

# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there. Do you have a favourite script? [Share it](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/issues/new) with us!

I'd like to thank Thorsten Blum for this weeks quickscript '**Remove trailing whitespace**' that removes trailing spaces from the selected text:

```
#lang racket/base
(require quickscript racket/string)
(define-script whitespace
  #:label "Remove trailing whitespace"
  (λ (selection)
    (let ([linebreak (string #\newline)])
      (string-join
       (map (λ (line)
              (string-trim line #px"\\s+" #:left? #f))
            (string-split selection linebreak))
       linebreak))))
```

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Beeswax](https://github.com/otherjoel/bookcover) by Joel Dueck.

From the website:

> Beeswax is a simple templating language. A Beeswax template wraps its contents in a function that can be imported by other modules and applied to data to get a rendered document. Having a #lang for your templates has a few small benefits: it lights up all the little conveniences of your IDE, if you use one (DrRacket, racket-mode, etc.); it’s a little easier to reason about and reuse in other contexts; and it can make renders faster (because the template can be compiled).
> 
> Beeswax was designed to be easy to use within Pollen projects, but can be of use in other Racket projects as well.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Complete monitors for behavioral contracts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PScp0v667feBCHfHXSAy9-Mi1TArpBPk/view?usp=sharing), by Christos Dimoulas, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> A behavioral contract in a higher-order language may invoke methods of unknown objects. Although this expressive power allows programmers to formulate sophisticated contracts, it also poses a problem for language designers. Indeed, two distinct semantics have emerged for such method calls, dubbed lax and picky. While lax fails to protect components in certain scenarios, picky may blame an uninvolved party for a contract violation.
> In this paper, we present complete monitoring as the fundamental correctness criterion for contract systems. It demands correct blame assignment as well as complete monitoring of all channels of communication between components. According to this criterion, lax and picky are indeed incorrect ways to monitor contracts. A third semantics, dubbed indy, emerges as the only correct variant.
