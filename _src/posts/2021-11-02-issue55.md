# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there. Do you have a favourite script? [Share it](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/issues/new) with us!

Rename Identifier is now available as a quickscript: 
```
#lang racket/base

(require quickscript
         racket/class
         racket/gui/base
         string-constants)

;;; License: [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or
;;;          [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) at your option.

(script-help-string "Rename the identifier under the cursor (if check syntax succeeded)")

(define-script rename-identifier
  #:label "Rename &Identifier"
  #:menu-path ("Re&factor")
  (λ (selection #:definitions defs)
    (define kmap (send defs get-keymap))
    ;; The last `#true` argument ensures that all keymaps in the chain are tried.
    (send kmap call-function (string-constant cs-rename-id) defs (new event%) #true)))

(module url2script-info racket/base
  (provide filename url)
  (define filename "rename-identifier.rkt")
  (define url "https://gist.github.com/Metaxal/a9dc34faaff4ec7e3c7872b63cc1b76f"))
```

This is useful if you have checked "Enable keybindings in menus" and you want to call "Rename identifier" via a keyboard shortcut (to customize in the quickscript), or via "Alt-s, f, i" (navigate the menus with the keyboard).

Installation: you can paste this into a new script via the menu: Scripts > Manage > New

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [north](https://docs.racket-lang.org/north/index.html) by Bogdan Popa.

From the website:

> `north` is a database migration tool written in Racket. It helps you keep your database schema in sync across all your environments.

I mentioned `north` in a previous issue when it was first released, however I was once reminded of how cool it is through [Bogdan's Koyo screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS_0-lqiSVs), which you should definitely take some time to watch if you haven't already.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Prototypes: Object-Orientation, Functionally](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tCCxq4olKwm21rEJ5O4QZLhyK2zxTtSY/view?usp=sharing) by François-René Rideau, Alex Knauth, and Nada Amin.

Abstract:

> This paper elucidates the essence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), using a constructive approach: we identify a minimal basis of concepts with which to synthesize existing and potential object systems. We reduce them to constructions atop the pure untyped lambda calculus, thereby obtaining both denotational semantics and effective implementation. We start from the simplest recognizable model of prototype-based OOP, so simple it arguably does not even have “objects” as such. We build further models of increasing sophistication, reproducing a growing subset of features found in past object systems, including original combinations. We also examine how our approach can deal with issues like typing, modularity, classes, mutation. We use Scheme to illustrate our approach.
