# What's New?

* [Racket v8.1](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2021/05/racket-v8-1.html) has been released. Among the highlights you'll find several improvements in Racket CS: cross compilation, android support and a handful of optimizations.
* Take a look at a video by Luis Quintanilla from Microsoft on [Building Web Services in Racket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvwE6_MMJjM). It's from February but somehow I missed it when it came out.

# Call to Racket!

Want to contribute to Racket? Don't know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.

Nobody has yet tackled last issue's `racket/pict` bug [#29](https://github.com/racket/pict/issues/29), so I will reinforce the Call to Racket again with the same issue. If you are interested in fixing this but need some guidance, feel free to comment on the issue page. Will you be our next Champion?

Good luck!

# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there. Do you have a favourite script? [Share it](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-news/issues/new) with us!

This weeks quickscript is a classic from the `quickscript-extra` collection.

In addition to keybindings, quickscripts can also add new custom menu's to DrRacket.  This script is a demo of that functionality.

```scheme
#lang racket/base
(require racket/gui/base
         racket/class
         quickscript)

(script-help-string "(Example) Shows how to dynamically add a menu to DrRacket.")

(define-script add-menu
  #:label "Add menu"
  #:menu-path ("E&xamples")
  (λ (str #:frame fr)  
    (define menu-bar (send fr get-menu-bar))
    (define menu (new menu% [parent menu-bar] [label "M&y Menu"]))
    (new menu-item% [parent menu] [label "&Remove me"]
         [callback (λ _ (send menu delete))])
    (define count 0)
    (new menu-item% [parent menu] [label "&Count me"]
         [callback (λ _ 
                     (set! count (add1 count))
                     (message-box "Count" (string-append "Count: " (number->string count)))
                     )])
    #f))
```

Installation: you can paste this into a new script - but check out the `quickscript-extra` collection for more goodies.

In DrRacket, in `File|Package manager|Source`, enter `quickscript-extra`.

Or, on the command line, type: `raco pkg install quickscript-extra`.

If DrRacket is already running, click on `Scripts|Manage scripts|Compile scripts and reload menu`.

[Quickscript](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/) is included in DrRacket, and scripts are managed by the **Script** menu. See the documentation at <https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/>.

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Bookcover](https://github.com/otherjoel/bookcover) by Joel Dueck.

From the website:

> Creating a cover for a printed book can be one of the most tedious parts of self-publishing. Printing services have requirements for the cover’s dimensions. You need to calculate the width of the book’s spine based on page count and paper type, add space for bleed, and so forth. If you change anything about the inside of your book, you need to run your calculations all over again.
> As an alternative to designing your book’s cover with a program like InDesign or Photoshop, you can instead implement it as a Racket program that dynamically calculates everything for you and generates the cover in PDF form each time it is run.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Chaperones and Impersonators: Run-time Support for Reasonable Interposition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MKbnv4IZSpciUas0jx_xft6k2nPGktQg/view?usp=sharing), by T. Stephen Strickland, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Robert Bruce Findler, and Matthew Flatt.

Abstract:

> Chaperones and impersonators provide run-time support for interposing on primitive operations such as function calls, array access and update, and structure field access and update. Unlike most interposition support, chaperones and impersonators are restricted so that they constrain the behavior of the interposing code to reasonable interposition, which in practice preserves the abstraction mechanisms and reasoning that programmers and compiler analyses rely on.
> Chaperones and impersonators are particularly useful for implementing contracts, and our implementation in Racket allows us to improve both the expressiveness and the performance of Racket's contract system. Specifically, contracts on mutable data can be enforced without changing the API to that data; contracts on large data structures can be checked lazily on only the accessed parts of the structure; contracts on objects and classes can be implemented with lower overhead; and contract wrappers can preserve object equality where appropriate. With this extension, gradual typing systems, such as Typed Racket, that rely on contracts for interoperation with untyped code can now pass mutable values safely between typed and untyped modules.
