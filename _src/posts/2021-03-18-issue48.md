    Title: Racket News - Issue 48
    Date: 2021-03-22T21:00:00

Welcome to the forty-eighth issue of Racket News.

Here is another issue of Racket News just before the RacketFest weekend - don't forget to join in the fun. Also, the Call to Racket PRs have been closed and we finally have our first champion for 2021: `xxyzz` solving not one but two Call to Racket issues - a double whammy. No blog posts unfortunately to list, so lets all get blogging!

Enjoy the issue with a good ol'espresso.

# What's New?

* Sage Gerard [has announced](https://groups.google.com/g/racket-users/c/j0rOqkaaDss/m/lLUjAKl1BgAJ) that [Xiden](https://github.com/zyrolasting/xiden), the functional dependency manager for Racket, is now in beta.
* Jack Firth, author of many packages including [Resyntax](https://github.com/jackfirth/resyntax), is looking for alpha testers: "especially people who frequently review Racket code such as teachers and teaching assistants in classes that use Racket". He says: "So far I’ve found that reading code written by students is bar none the most effective way to come up with ideas for code improvements that Resyntax could suggest.". If you are interested in helping, feel free to [send him an email](mailto:jackhfirth@gmail.com).
* Who hasn't heard of [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)? I am sure that book as shaped many a Racketeer. Well, Gerald Jay Sussman has a new book on the block: [Software Design Flexibility](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility).
* [Racket Stories](https://racket-stories.com) has close to 400 links to Racket related stuff. Help it get to 500. Submit blog posts, libraries, one off Racket hacks, ... New or old doesn't matter - if it is interesting to you, it's probably interesting to others as well. And don't forget to vote on the stories.
* [RacketFest Amateur Night](https://racketfest.com/) is coming this weekend - make sure you don't miss it!

# Call to Racket!

Want to contribute to Racket? Don't know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.

Our double Call to Racket champion was `xxyzz` who closed successfully [#3603](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3603) with [d03456b](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/d03456b55e9321d491b5a936cf721466728376e2) and [#2883](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/2883) with [cc9956a](https://github.com/racket/racket/commit/c9956aceaeecb3be747c152c323b7010a371816b). Congrats! Call to Racket is taking a break this issue, so take a breather and will be back next issue with a brand new issue to fix.

# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there.

This issue we have two classics that I use every day, [Open file directory](https://github.com/Metaxal/quickscript-extra/blob/master/scripts/open-dir.rkt) that opens the files folder in you OS's GUI Finder/File Explorer/etc. (code below), and [Open terminal here](https://github.com/Metaxal/quickscript-extra/blob/master/scripts/open-terminal.rkt) that opens a command line terminal set the the directory/folder of the currently selected file. 

Both are available in the [quickscript-extra package](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript-extra) and are easily installed: 
Using the the graphical package manger in DrRacket (`File>Package manager`) enter `quickscript-extra` in the Source field, or, from the command line,`raco pkg install quickscript-extra`.

If DrRacket is already running, click on `Scripts|Manage scripts|Compile
scripts and reload menu`.

```scheme
#lang racket/base
(require racket/system
         racket/path
         quickscript)

(script-help-string "Open the system's file browser in the current directory.")

(define cmd
  (case (system-type 'os)
    [(unix)    "xdg-open"] ; or maybe mimeopen -n ?
    [(windows) "explorer"]
    [(macosx)  "open"]))

(define-script open-file-directory
  #:label "Open file directory"
  #:menu-path ("&Utils")
  (λ (str #:file f)
    (system (string-append cmd " \"" (path->string (path-only f)) "\""))
    #f))
```
[Quickscript](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/) is included in DrRacket, and scripts are managed by the **Script** menu. See the documentation at https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [Landau](https://gitlab.iaaras.ru/iaaras/landau) by Ivan Dolgakov.

From the website:

> Landau is a language for dynamical systems with automatic differentiation.
> Landau is a Turing incomplete statically typed domain-specific differentiable language. The Turing incompleteness provides the ability of sophisticated source code analysis and, as a result, a highly optimized compiled code. Among other things, the language syntax supports functions, compile-time ranged for loops, if/else branching constructions, real variables and arrays, and the ability to manually discard calculation where the automatic derivatives values are expected to be negligibly small. In spite of reasonable restrictions, the language is rich enough to express and differentiate any cumbersome paper-equation with practically no effort.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Fortifying Macros](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ncEJXZYwCJzIpgzUlsf0Hx-9InlIYN3x/view?usp=sharing) by Ryan Culpepper.

Abstract:

> Existing macro systems force programmers to make a choice between clarity of specification and robustness. If they choose clarity, they must forgo validating significant parts of the specification and thus produce low-quality language extensions. If they choose robustness, they must write in a style that mingles the implementation with the specification and therefore obscures the latter. This paper introduces a new language for writing macros. With the new macro system, programmers naturally write robust language extensions using easy-to-understand specifications. The system translates these specifications into validators that detect misuses—including violations of context-sensitive constraints—and automatically synthesize appropriate feedback, eliminating the need for ad hoc validation code.
