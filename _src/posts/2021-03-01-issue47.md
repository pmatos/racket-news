# What's New?

* I have released an initial version of [racket-binaryen](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-binaryen/). This is a set of experimental but complete bindings for [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) in Racket. Why experimental? Well, it's lacking safe bindings and documentation but that will come next. Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly and bringing it to Racket will hopefully satisfy all your WebAssembly needs. I shall create a proper package once the initial set of safe bindings are implemented and documented.
* Racket Discord goes bot crazy! An example bot for Discord [R16](https://git.sr.ht/~williewillus/r16/) by Alwinfy, Vincent Lee [@williewillus](https://github.com/williewillus) and Benedek Szilvasy [@eutro](https://github.com/eutro) allows users to register and execute short code snippets in a sandbox from Discord commands. [Join the Racket discord](https://discord.gg/6Zq8sH5) and try it on the `#bots` channel:

```
!rkt eval (require math/number-theory) (factorize 120)
```

    which will reply with `((2 3) (3 1) (5 1))` or

    ```
    !!instant-tshirt (cons
      'Racket
      'News)
    ```

    which will reply with

# Call to Racket!

Want to contribute to Racket? Don't know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.

There has been no attempts on [issue 2883](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/2883) of Racket. For the last time, and your change to shine, the call is still on. Who's going to have a go at this one? It can be you! If you are interested in fixing this but need some guidance, feel free to comment on the issue page. Will you be our next Champion? 

Good luck!

# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there.

Don't wait for [Jack Firth’s resyntax](https://docs.racket-lang.org/resyntax), fix your #t and #f today!

(_[resyntax](https://docs.racket-lang.org/resyntax) is an experimental refactoring tool built on top of [syntax-parse](https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax-parse-example)._)

[Quickscript](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/) is included in DrRacket, and scripts are managed by the **Script** menu. See the documentation at https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript/

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [`molis-hai`](https://www.brinckerhoff.org/molis-hai/pwgen.html) by John Clements.

From the website:

> This collection produces passwords using models built on a corpus of source text. It manages to guarantee generation of passwords with known entropy by building markov models whose transitions are guided by huffman trees, allowing the use of variable numbers of bits of entropy for each transition.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Gradual typing for first-class classes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VYLsVAx1sUycmQWrXOB_6fwGAijTKVQ8/view?usp=sharing) by Asumu Takikawa, T. Stephen Strickland, Christos Dimoulas, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Dynamic type-checking and object-oriented programming often go hand-in-hand; scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript all embrace object-oriented (OO) programming. When scripts written in such languages grow and evolve into large programs, the lack of a static type discipline reduces maintainability. A programmer may thus wish to migrate parts of such scripts to a sister language with a static type system. Unfortunately, existing type systems neither support the flexible OO composition mechanisms found in scripting languages nor accommodate sound interoperation with untyped code.
> In this paper, we present the design of a gradual typing system that supports sound interaction between statically and dynamically-typed units of class-based code. The type system uses row polymorphism for classes and thus supports mixin-based OO composition. To protect migration of mixins from typed to untyped components, the system employs a novel form of contracts that partially seal classes. The design comes with a theorem that guarantees the soundness of the type system even in the presence of untyped components.
