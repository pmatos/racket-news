    Title: Racket News - Issue 47
    Date: 2021-03-01T21:00:00

Welcome to the forty-seventh issue of Racket News.

Here's another issue of Racket News full of goodness. There's quite a bit of WebAssembly this issue but also crazy Discord bots and quite a few package releases. On the other hand, we are missing blog posts on Racket. To spice things up, we also have a new experimental section on DrRacket Quickscripts, which you can use to enhance your favourite Racket editor. 

Grab a coffee and lets dive in!

# What's New?

* Jesse has posted a first draft of the lineup for [RacketFest](https://racketfest.com/). Make sure to [check it out](https://racketfest.com/#schedule) and register while there are still places left.
* I have released an initial version of [racket-binaryen](https://github.com/pmatos/racket-binaryen/). This is a set of experimental but complete bindings for [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) in Racket. Why experimental? Well, it's lacking safe bindings and documentation but that will come next. Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly and bringing it to Racket will hopefully satisfy all your WebAssembly needs. I shall create a proper package once the initial set of safe bindings are implemented and documented.
* Still on WebAssembly, there is a [large effort to model the WebAssembly language syntax, semantics, and validation rules](https://github.com/atgeller/WASM-Redex) in Redex. This feels like an extension to [work done by Asumu Takikawa](https://www.asumu.xyz/blog/2019/04/29/webassembly-in-redex/) a few years ago on the same topic.
* I also recently learned Jay McCarthy gave a presentation in Strange Loop on [Continuations on the Web and in your OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAMtstt3Jp8) - time to grab some popcorn!
* Racket Discord goes bot crazy! An example bot for Discord [R16](https://git.sr.ht/~williewillus/r16/) by Alwinfy, Vincent Lee [@williewillus](https://github.com/williewillus) and Benedek Szilvasy [@eutro](https://github.com/eutro) allows users to register and execute short code snippets in a sandbox from Discord commands. [Join the Racket discord](https://discord.gg/6Zq8sH5) and try it on the `#bots` channel:

```
> !rkt eval (require math/number-theory) (factorize 120)
((2 3) (3 1) (5 1))
```

```
> !!instant-tshirt (cons

# DrRacket Quickscript of the day

Quickscript (featured project of [issue 38](https://racket-news.com/2020/09/racket-news-issue-38.html)) provides an easy way to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket. In this new section, contributed by Stephen De Gabrielle, we will be highlighting some of the most interesting scripts out there.

Don't wait for [Jack Firth’s resyntax](https://docs.racket-lang.org/resyntax), fix your #t and #f today!

(_[resyntax](https://docs.racket-lang.org/resyntax) is an experimental refactoring tool built on top of [syntax-parse](https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax-parse-example)._)

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [`molis-hai`](https://www.brinckerhoff.org/molis-hai/pwgen.html) by John Clements.

From the website:

> This collection produces passwords using models built on a corpus of source text. It manages to guarantee generation of passwords with known entropy by building markov models whose transitions are guided by huffman trees, allowing the use of variable numbers of bits of entropy for each transition.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Gradual typing for first-class classes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VYLsVAx1sUycmQWrXOB_6fwGAijTKVQ8/view?usp=sharing) by Asumu Takikawa, T. Stephen Strickland, Christos Dimoulas, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, and Matthias Felleisen.

Abstract:

> Dynamic type-checking and object-oriented programming often go hand-in-hand; scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript all embrace object-oriented (OO) programming. When scripts written in such languages grow and evolve into large programs, the lack of a static type discipline reduces maintainability. A programmer may thus wish to migrate parts of such scripts to a sister language with a static type system. Unfortunately, existing type systems neither support the flexible OO composition mechanisms found in scripting languages nor accommodate sound interoperation with untyped code.
> In this paper, we present the design of a gradual typing system that supports sound interaction between statically and dynamically-typed units of class-based code. The type system uses row polymorphism for classes and thus supports mixin-based OO composition. To protect migration of mixins from typed to untyped components, the system employs a novel form of contracts that partially seal classes. The design comes with a theorem that guarantees the soundness of the type system even in the presence of untyped components.
