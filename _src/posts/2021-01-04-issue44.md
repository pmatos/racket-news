    Title: Racket News - Issue 44
    Date: 2021-01-06T21:00:00

Welcome to the forty-fourth issue of Racket News and Happy New Year.

Finally, 2020 is behind us and all we can do is hope for a better year this time around. This issue comes with a delay but with a huge amount of content, although hopefully not too much. We have the usual sections and a few others reviewing the last year. I certainly didn't manage to cover everything and I probably didn't mention everyone that deserved a mention. If you think I am at fault here regarding your contributions, please [drop me a line](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

We have a new sponsors section at the end of the issue. I will discuss this in more detail in an upcoming blog post. For now, let me thank Jesse Alama for sponsoring my work. If you wish to sponsor my work on Racket News, and more generally on the Racket ecosystem, check out my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/pmatos/) page.

Grab a very long, but not too hot, coffee and enjoy!

# Project in the Spotlight

This week's project in the spotlight is [`crypto`](http://rmculpepper.github.io/crypto/) by Ryan Culpepper.

From the website:

> This library provides an interface for cryptographic operations, including message digests, symmetric-key encryption, and public-key signatures, encryption, and key agreement.

# Featured Racket Paper

This issue's featured paper is [Profile-Guided Meta-Programming](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11pZQxlVPpOT47il4jStiBfcky4Rf0a7x/view?usp=sharing) by William J. Bowman, Swaha Miller, Vincent St-Amour, and R. Kent Dybvig.

Abstract:

> Contemporary compiler systems such as GCC, .NET, and LLVM incorporate profile-guided optimizations (PGOs) on low-level intermediate code and basic blocks, with impressive results over purely static heuristics. Recent work shows that profile information is also useful for performing source-to-source optimizations via meta-programming. For example, using profiling information to inform decisions about data structures and algorithms can potentially lead to asymptotic improvements in performance.
> 
> We present a design for profile-guided meta-programming in a general-purpose meta-programming system. Our design is parametric over the particular profiler and meta-programming system. We implement this design in two different meta-programming systems - the syntactic extensions systems of Chez Scheme and Racket— and provide several profile-guided meta-programs as usability case studies.

# Upcoming Meetups

Do you know of any upcoming meetups I can advertise? [Let me know](mailto:pmatos@linki.tools).

* Racket users video meetup - Jan 9, 2021 at 8pm CET, via [Gather Town](https://gather.town/app/wH1EDG3McffLjrs0/racket-users). There'll be (optionally) lightning talks and the paper for discussion (optional pre-reading) is the featured paper: [Macros for Domain-Specific Languages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XMPoRJgrmAJ934qDZSCQ8p8_rvNEe0b/view?usp=sharing).

# 2020 - Year in review

The year of 2020 started with the release of [Racket 7.6](https://download.racket-lang.org/v7.6.html), after which we got three more releases with the latest in November: [Racket 7.9](https://download.racket-lang.org/v7.9.html). 

The core team wrote [9 blog posts](https://blog.racket-lang.org/) in 2020. They wrote an [update on Racket CS](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/02/racket-on-chez-status.html) in February 2020 and we are now at a point in which, Racket CS will become the default variant of Racket as of its next release.

In [Racket 7.6](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/02/racket-v7-6.html), we got improved DrRacket scrolling and dark mode support with the announcement that Racket CS was ready for production use.

In [Racket 7.7](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/05/racket-v7-7.html), Racket CS started supporting the C API for embedding into other applications and it started using a new HAMT implementation thereby reducing the memory required for immutable hash tables. GC got faster for Racket CS and the Cairo library can now be multi-threaded.

In [Racket 7.8](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/08/racket-v7-8.html), Racket CS started supporting Aarch32 (`arm32`) and Aarch64 (`arm64`), including places and futures. The Racket CS GC got an incremental GC mode and started unboxing local floating point arithmetic. The web server concurrency got better by up to an order of magnitude. The `plot` package started being maintained by Alex Harsányi and the `math` package by Pavel Pancheka and Jens Axel Søgaard.

And to finish off the year, we got [Racket 7.9](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/11/racket-v7-9.html) in November. Racket CS GC started supporting parallel collection among many other small fixes and improvements in order to get Racket CS stable enough to become the default Racket variant.

This was just a brief summary of the major release points, a lot of work has gone into all parts of the Racket ecosystem although a lot of focus has gone into stabilizing and improving the CS variant. 

Racket turned 25, and [Matthias and Matthew](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/05/racket-is-25.html) wrote about that. Due to the worldwide COVID19 pandemic all in-person meetings were turned upside down and Zoom became the word of the day. However, Jesse Alama managed to organize an in-person [RacketFest](https://racketfest.com/) back in February 2020, in Berlin - Germany. Racket Summer School was unfortunately cancelled and [RacketCon became a virtual conference](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2020/10/tenth-racketcon.html). 

We had the great Racket Survey whose results where discussed in RacketCon by Sam Tobin-Hochstadt in his State of Racket, and also a short Typed Racket survey later in the year.

Stephen De Gabrielle and Laurent Orseau ran a [Quickscript competition](https://github.com/Quickscript-Competiton/July2020entries). Sam Philips together with Stephen De Gabrielle started a Racket Users video meetup after the huge success through Gather Town of RacketCon.

In terms of contributions, we had a wide-range of contributions and contributors. In 2020 there were 90 different contributors for the racket main repos (the same we have been gathering statistics for). These are:

* `97jaz`
* Alex Bartholomew
* Alex Harsányi

I have used yearly statistics to plot the evolution of the number of commits, issues and prs for a few of the main projects. The plots should be self-explanatory. 

*Note*: A problem with the datasets meant that in the first few hours after publishing, the plots reflected incorrect values. This is now fixed. Thanks to Sorawee for noticing and pointing it out to me.
